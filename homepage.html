	<p>Constructing a research paper is an integral part of being a graduate student in the Information Architecture, Technical Communication and Information Design, and Technical Communication programs at IIT.<p>


	<p>There is no right or wrong way to put a paper together, but there are a wealth of tools available to make the process efficient and manageable. In this course, you will find an explanation of the basic steps involved in writing a research paper, as well as a selection of tools that complement certain steps.</p>
